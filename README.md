# Mesa_Files_aEMSs
This repository contains the files used to build the accreting extremely massive star presented in the paper in prep. L. Ramírez-Galeano et. al 2025. 

The inlist included here was run with MESA r22.11.1 and the 23.7.2 version of the SDK. 

 The folder **Mass_loss_grids** contains the predictions for the mass-loss and mass-gain induced by an individual collision. The range of masses and the difference between the treatment of convection is describe in L. Ramírez-Galeano et. al 2025.
